# Rust HTTP Client and Server

This project implements a simple HTTP client and server using Rust. The client can make GET and POST requests, while the server listens for incoming requests and responds accordingly.

├── Cargo.toml         # Rust project configuration file
└── README.md          # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your machine. You can install it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
